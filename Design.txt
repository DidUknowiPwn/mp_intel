Goal: 

Capture one of three intels located within the level and upload it as your base.

Design:

Three intel gameobjects spawn within the level and each has a percentage of being the "correct" intel (percentages totalling 100%).
Intel is picked up and taken back to team's base where it has to be uploaded & validated which takes a total of 5 seconds.
	* Validation is done based on the intel percentage / 100.

A point is awarded if the intel is correct and the intel's are reset.

Enemy team can attack friendly base and steal their intel by hijacking the upload center which takes 15 seconds where the friendly team will be notified of it being taken.

Objects:

[Intel, Gameobjects]
-Model: laptop
-Trigger: pick up

[Base, Gameobjects]

-Trigger: upload intel (friendly), steal intel (enemy)
